# Editor Gateway

The gateway lets external tools, scripts and AI agents drive a running Voltage Editor, and a built game too. It is a loopback TCP server inside the process; every request is executed on the game thread between frames, so handlers see the same state the UI does and their edits land in the undo history.

The transport and the host-neutral commands (`ping`, `status`, `log.*`, `console.*`, `screenshot`, `input.*`, `events.*`, `wait.event`, `batch`) live in the engine (`Voltage.Engine/Gateway`, namespace `Voltage.Gateway`). The editor adds its own commands and events on top in `Voltage.Editor/Gateway`. A built game gets the engine set only.

## Connecting

The editor starts the gateway on `127.0.0.1:47800` and writes `gateway.json` next to `Settings.json` in the editor data folder (`%APPDATA%\VoltageEngine\Editor` on Windows):

```json
{ "port": 47800, "token": "…", "pid": 12345, "started": "…", "exe": "…\\Voltage.Editor.exe", "args": [], "logs": "…\\Logs" }
```

The file is left behind when the editor exits: the pid tells clients it is gone, and the exe path is what `voltage start` relaunches.

Command-line flags: `--gateway-port N` picks another port (`0` = any free port), `--no-gateway` disables it, `--gateway-info <path>` writes the discovery file somewhere else (pair it with the CLI's `--config`), and `--gateway-safe` starts the safety profile described below.

A built game does not listen unless it is started with `--gateway` or with `VOLTAGE_GATEWAY=1` in its environment. It then writes its discovery file to `<user app data>/VoltageEngine/Runtime/gateway.json` (`%APPDATA%\VoltageEngine\Runtime` on Windows) with `"host": "game"` and the game's window title under `"game"`; the editor's file says `"host": "editor"`. Requests over 4 MB close the connection.

The protocol is newline-delimited UTF-8 JSON. The first line a client sends must be `{"auth":"<token>"}`; the server answers with a `hello` event. After that:

```
→ {"id": 1, "method": "entity.create", "params": {"name": "Player", "x": 100}}
← {"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": {…}}
← {"id": 2, "ok": false, "error": "entity not found: Foo"}
← {"event": "log", "data": {"type": "Warn", "message": "…", "time": "…", "caller": "Scene", "line": 42}}
```

`id` is echoed back verbatim and may be any JSON value. Requests without an id still run but get no reply. Events are only sent to clients that asked for them (`log.subscribe`).

While at least one client is connected the editor keeps updating and drawing when it loses focus, so an agent can work while the user is in another window. A minimized window still updates but skips drawing.

## CLI

`Voltage.Cli` builds to `voltage`, a thin client that reads `gateway.json` for you:

```
voltage status
voltage doctor                    # gateway.json, process, port, build age, SDK, .mcp.json, as OK/WARN/FAIL lines
voltage help                      # every method with its flags; voltage help entity.set lists its parameters
voltage entity.list --table       # lists of objects as an aligned table
voltage status --field scene.name # one value out of the result
voltage entity.set entity=Player x=0 y=0 rotation=90
voltage scripts.compile reloadScene=true
voltage logs --follow --level Error --grep "Gateway|Exception" --since 60
voltage watch --logs --filter scene.*   # lifecycle events (and log lines) as they happen; --json prints raw lines
voltage run steps.json            # replay a recorded {"steps": [...]} script, or a list of {method, params} calls
voltage pipe                      # one JSON request per stdin line; ideal for agents
voltage start [project.voltage] --headless --no-prompts   # relaunch the last editor (plus launch flags) and wait for its gateway
voltage stop                      # ask it to quit and wait until the process is gone
voltage restart --rebuild         # stop, dotnet build the editor project next to its exe, start again
voltage --version                 # CLI version plus the running host's engine version
```

`start` and `restart` accept `--headless`, `--safe`, `--no-prompts` and `--gateway-port N` and pass them to the editor (`--safe` becomes `--gateway-safe`), replacing any recorded copy of the same flag; with `--config`, they also pass `--gateway-info` so the new instance writes its discovery file where this CLI reads it. `stop` sends `editor.exit force=true` (or `app.exit` with `--game`) and fails if the pid is still alive after `--wait` seconds; an instance started with `--gateway-safe` refuses exits, so stop that one from its window. `restart --rebuild` finds `Voltage.Editor.csproj` from the recorded `bin/<Configuration>/<rid>/Voltage.Editor.exe` path, builds that configuration after the old instance is gone, and only then relaunches, which is the edit, rebuild, relaunch loop an agent runs on the engine itself.

Values are parsed as JSON when they look like it (`true`, `12.5`, `[1,2]`, `{"x":1}`) and as strings otherwise. `--timeout <sec>` applies to every request; `--exe <path>` tells `start` where the editor is the first time; `--config <path>` reads another discovery file (the one an editor started with `--gateway-info` wrote). `--compact` prints one line, `--table` formats lists of flat objects or objects of scalars, and `--field a.b.0` prints a single value (strings raw, everything else as JSON).

`voltage record steps.json` records the mouse, keyboard and typed text (physical or synthetic, since it samples the state the editor actually saw) until you press Enter, and writes them as an `input.script` file: `move`, `down`, `up`, `scroll`, `keyDown`, `keyUp`, `type` and the `wait` frames between them. Edit it and replay it with `voltage run`; `input.record action=start|stop|status` is the underlying command and works without the CLI; a recording outlives the connection that started it, so you can start it, work by hand, and stop it from a later call (it is capped at 100k steps and ends with the editor).

`voltage run` takes either an `input.script` payload (`{"steps": [...]}`) or a JSON array of `{"method": ..., "params": {...}}` calls, which run one by one and stop at the first failure (`--continue` keeps going, `--batch` sends them as one `batch` request).

`voltage completion bash|zsh|pwsh` prints a completion script; the header of each says where to install it. Subcommands and options complete offline; method names and `key=` parameter names come from the running editor's `commands` and are cached in `gateway-commands.txt` beside `gateway.json`, so they still complete when the editor is down. The scripts complete a command named `voltage`, so put a `voltage` shim or the published executable on your PATH; a script generated with `--config` calls back with the same file.

## MCP

`voltage mcp` is a Model Context Protocol server over stdio. Every gateway method becomes a tool with dots replaced by underscores (`entity_create`). A command registered with a `P.*` parameter table gets a typed input schema (types, enums, defaults, required list, `additionalProperties: false`); one without it still gets properties parsed from the `params:` part of its help. The `readOnly`, `destructive` and `unsafe` flags become the MCP annotations `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint` and `idempotentHint`, and unsafe tools say so in their description. `screenshot` returns the PNG as image content so a multimodal agent can look at the editor.

The server also serves resources: `voltage://screenshot/latest` (the last capture taken through this server, image/png), `voltage://editor/status`, `voltage://editor/commands`, `voltage://editor/scene` (JSON) and `voltage://editor/log` (the last 200 lines). It subscribes to editor events and sends `notifications/tools/list_changed` after `scripts.compiled` and `project.loaded`, so a client refreshes its tool list when the command set can have changed. The tool list is cached in `gateway-tools.json` so it exists before the editor is up; the connection is made lazily and re-made if the editor restarts.

```
claude mcp add voltage -- C:\path\to\voltage.exe mcp
```

## Built games

A built game answers the same protocol with the engine command set (`ping`, `status`, `commands`, `log.*`, `console.*`, `screenshot`, `input.*`, `events.*`, `wait.event`, `batch`, `app.exit`) as soon as it is started with `--gateway`, or with `VOLTAGE_GATEWAY=1` in its environment. `--gateway-port N`, `--gateway-info <path>` and `--gateway-safe` work as in the editor. The discovery file goes to `%APPDATA%\VoltageEngine\Runtime\gateway.json` (the `Runtime` sibling of the editor's folder on every platform) unless `--gateway-info` says otherwise; `status.host` is `game`, `status.game` is the game's assembly name, and screenshots default to the `Screenshots` folder next to the file.

```
voltage build.run gateway=true            # launch the last build listening; answers {pid, port, gatewayInfo} once it does
voltage start --game path\to\Game.exe     # or launch any built game directly
voltage --game status                     # every command takes --game (or VOLTAGE_TARGET=game) to target the runtime file
voltage --game screenshot scale=0.5
voltage --game input.key key=space
voltage --game app.exit
```

`voltage doctor` reports both files. The gateway serializes its answers with reflection, which a NativeAOT publish with trimming may strip, so `--gateway` is meant for debug and test builds (`build.run debug=true` launches those); a project with `PublishAot` still works in its plain `dotnet build` output because the engine names its resolver explicitly.

## Methods

`component.set`, `scenecomponent.set` and `data.set` share one value language: numbers, strings, booleans, enums by name, `{x,y}` or `{x,y,z}` for vectors and points, `{r,g,b,a}` or `#RRGGBB[AA]` for colours, `{x,y,width,height}` for rectangles, seconds or `hh:mm:ss.fff` for durations, an asset path or GUID for asset and prefab references, an entity key for entity references and Entity/Transform fields, and `Entity/Type` for component references. Lists and arrays take a JSON array for the whole member, `Clips[2]` for one element, `Clips[+]` to append, and `remove=true` with an index to drop an element; elements that are data objects take a JSON object of their fields, and dotted paths continue into them (`Bindings[0].Entity`). A member marked `[AssetType]` rejects an asset the inspector would not accept, naming the type it wants. Component and scene-component edits, `component.remove` and `prefab.revert` are undoable; data asset edits are written straight to disk through the shared asset cache, so an open Data Asset window for the same file sees them too. On `entity.set`, only the position change is undoable; the other fields mark the scene dirty without an undo entry. `component.get` lists every member the gateway can write under `values`.

`view.focus entity=Player zoom=2` points the game view at something before a screenshot; `screenshot x=0 y=0 width=400 height=300` crops a window region so small text stays legible at reduced scale.

`asset.drop` does what dragging from the Asset Browser does: a prefab instantiates, a texture or Aseprite file becomes a sprite entity, and the result is selected and undoable. `build.game` runs the same publish the Build window does and answers with the output folder and executable (`aot=false` skips Native AOT and trimming for a fast self-contained build that needs no C++ toolchain); `build.run gateway=true` launches it listening and answers once its discovery file names that process.

`events.subscribe` streams `editor` events; `voltage watch` prints them. The editor emits `scene.loaded`, `scene.saved`, `scene.created`, `scene.reset`, `play.started`, `play.stopped`, `play.paused`, `play.resumed`, `scripts.compiled`, `project.loaded`, `project.unloaded`, plus state diffs taken once per frame: `selection.changed {entities}`, `scene.dirty {dirty}`, `undo.changed {undo, redo}`, `entity.added {id, name, guid}` and `entity.removed {id}` (a change of more than 32 entities at once collapses into one `entities.changed {added, removed}`).

`wait.event name=scene.loaded timeout=30` answers with the next matching event (`{name, data}`) or fails when the timeout passes; `name` may be exact, a group prefix such as `scene.*`, or `*`. `batch requests=[{method, params}, …]` runs requests in order on the main thread, waits for deferred answers such as `scripts.compile` before moving on, and replies once with `{results: [{ok, result | error}], failed}`; `stopOnError=false` keeps going past a failure. In the editor, `undoGroup="Build level"` folds every undoable edit the batch makes into one undo step, and `undo.group action=begin|end` does the same for requests sent separately.

## Authoring

`project.create name= directory=` builds a project the way the New Project window does, copies the editor's compiled engine effects into it, and opens it; `scene.create` writes an empty scene (or `template=copy` saves the open one under a new name). `prefab.create entity=` saves a `.vprefab` and leaves a linked instance in the scene, `prefab.apply` writes an instance back to the file and onto its copies, `prefab.revert` reloads it from the prefab, and `prefab.open` / `prefab.close` enter and leave the isolated prefab edit scene. `tilemap.paint`, `tilemap.fill` (rectangle or `flood=true`), `tilemap.erase` and `tilemap.collision` edit a `TilemapRenderer` cell by cell with the same undo steps the palette records, and `tileset.create` writes a `.vtileset` for a texture. Timeline edits (`timeline.track.*`, `timeline.clip.*`, `timeline.key.*`) load the `.vtimeline`, change it and save it straight away; the file edit is one undo step that swaps the whole file back (a change made to the file in between is overwritten, with a warning in the log), and directors bound to the file and an open Timeline window reread it. `timeline.events` and `timeline.properties` list the `[TimelineEvent]` methods and `[TimelineProperty]` members the compiled scripts registered, `timeline.validate asset=` (or `entity=` for a director with its bindings) reports what would not resolve at play, `timeline.bind` and `timeline.unbind` edit a director's role bindings, `timeline.director` drives a `TimelineDirector` on an entity and `animation.play` a `SpriteAnimator`. Script files are authored with `script.create name= template=component|scenecomponent|dataasset|empty` (the same templates as the Asset Browser's New Script menu), `script.write` and `script.delete`, each compiling afterwards and answering with the diagnostics; `script.list` shows the files with the types they declare. Script edits are compiled and run by the editor, the same trust level as `scripts.compile`, so they carry the destructive flag. A script edit is a file change like any other, so the script watcher hot-reloads the scene from disk as well: save unsaved scene work first. `audio.zone.create type=ambience|music|reverb|snapshot|crowd|ducking` adds a zone entity with a trigger collider, and `audio.mixer.set` changes a bus for the session. `asset.import source=` copies a file into the Content folder and creates its `.meta` GUID; `asset.importAseprite ... entity=true` also drops it into the scene as an animated sprite. Every destination path must stay inside the project.

Entities are addressed by numeric id, persistent GUID or name (`entity=Player`). Numeric ids are runtime counters that change on every scene load, so prefer the GUID or name when a reference must outlive a reload. `scene.load` refuses to discard unsaved changes unless `force=true`. `project.load`, `scripts.compile`, `screenshot` and every `input.*` command answer once the work has actually finished.

## Navigating like a person

Prefer clicking by label over coordinates. The editor draws its widgets through a thin wrapper that records every button, menu item, selectable, checkbox, tab, tree node, header and input field with its on-screen rectangle, so `ui.tree` lists what is on screen without a screenshot, `ui.find label=Play` locates a widget, and `ui.click label="Player (4)" window="Scene Graph"` presses it with the same synthetic input a coordinate click would use. Menus are addressed by path: `ui.click path="View/Window/Core Window"` opens each level and clicks the last, skipping levels that are already open. `ui.hover` parks the cursor on a widget so a tooltip shows in the next screenshot, `ui.focus window=` brings a window to the front, and `ui.windows` reports every window, popup and modal with its rectangle. A miss answers with nearby labels. Widgets drawn by plugins that call ImGui directly are not recorded; fall back to coordinates for those.

`ui.resize width=1600 height=900` fixes the window size first, so coordinates learned from one screenshot stay valid for the next. `screenshot` captures the whole editor window after the next frame (`window=false` gives the game view only). `scale=0.5` returns a quarter of the pixels, which is usually still readable and much cheaper for a model to look at; coordinates in the image times `1/scale` are window pixels. `ui.info` reports the window size and cursor position.

The `input.*` commands feed the engine's own input state, which ImGui and the game both read, so a synthetic click lands on the real widget, fires the real handler, and produces the real undo entry. Steps are spaced across frames the way ImGui needs (press, settle, release). Once any synthetic input has been sent the gateway owns the mouse and keyboard until `input.release`, so a stray hand on the physical mouse cannot fight the agent; the devices are handed back automatically when the last client disconnects.

While captured, the virtual cursor also drives `Input.MousePositionDelta` and the engine's double-click detector, so game code that reads those sees a synthetic drag or `input.click count=2` exactly as it would a physical one; `input.state` reports the last delta and whether the most recent script double-clicked. `input.hover x= y= frames=10` parks the cursor so a tooltip has time to open before a `screenshot`.

`input.script` runs a list of steps in one request. A `waitEvent` step holds the script until the editor emits a matching event (`scene.loaded`, `selection.*`, `*`) and fails the rest of the script after `timeout` seconds (default 30):

```json
{"steps": [
  {"action": "click", "x": 14, "y": 8},
  {"action": "wait", "frames": 5},
  {"action": "type", "text": "Hello\n"},
  {"action": "key", "key": "s", "modifiers": ["ctrl"]},
  {"action": "waitEvent", "name": "scene.saved", "timeout": 10},
  {"action": "release"}
]}
```

`hotkey.list` shows the editor's rebindable commands and `hotkey.press id=Global.SaveScene` presses whatever keys are bound to one.

## Prompts and modals

A modal swallows every click outside it, so an unattended agent has to notice one before doing anything else. `ui.popups` lists the open popups and modals with the buttons that answer them (`ui.click label=No window="Missing Engine Effects"` presses one), `ui.windows` marks them `modal: true`, and subscribed clients get `ui.modal {name, open}` whenever one opens or closes.

`--no-prompts` keeps the startup prompts closed instead: Missing Engine Effects and Plugins Needed log a warning, are reported in `status.suppressedPrompts`, and reach subscribed clients as `prompt.suppressed {name, detail}`. The user's own "don't show again" setting is never written. What those prompts offer is available as commands: `plugin.list` says which declared plugins are missing and why (`fetchable`, `unpublished`, `brokenLocal`, `missingInRepo`), `plugin.restore [name=]` fetches the fetchable ones the way the prompt's Install button does, `effects.status` reports whether compiled engine effects exist, and `effects.compile` builds them. The unsaved-changes prompt stays; the commands that can trigger it take `force=true`.

## Headless and CI

`--headless` hides the SDL window at startup, fixes the size at 1600x900, keeps the loop running with or without a client, and implies `--no-prompts`. The hidden window still owns the GL context, so drawing continues into the back buffer and `screenshot` returns the same frame a visible editor would show; `status` reports `headless: true`.

`Voltage.Editor.Tests` runs the gateway end to end: it writes a small project into a temp folder, starts the built editor with `--headless --gateway-port 0 --gateway-info <tmp>/gateway.json <project>.voltage` and `VOLTAGE_EDITOR_DATA` pointed at a fresh data folder, then exercises entities, components, undo, batches, events, synthetic input, click-by-label, screenshots and script compilation before `editor.exit force=true`. Run it with `dotnet test Voltage.Editor.Tests -c Editor-Debug` after building the editor; `VOLTAGE_EDITOR_EXE` overrides the executable and `VOLTAGE_TESTS_KEEP=1` leaves the temp folder behind. The `gateway-tests` CI job runs the same suite on Linux under Xvfb with Mesa and on Windows with a software `opengl32.dll` beside the editor; both are marked as unverified on hosted runners until they have been seen passing there.

## Crashes

An unhandled exception writes `crash_<timestamp>.log` (with the tail of the editor log) to the logs folder and exits the process immediately, so no OS error dialog waits for a person. The CLI names the crash log when it finds the editor gone, and `voltage start` brings it back with the same arguments. `debug.crash confirm=true` exercises that whole path on purpose.

Claude Code picks the MCP server up from `.mcp.json` in the repo root, which runs the `Voltage.Cli/bin/mcp` copy of the Editor-Debug build through `dotnet`; the CLI build refreshes that copy so a running MCP server never locks the build output (a server started before a rebuild keeps the old copy until it restarts).

## Adding a method

Editor handlers live in `Voltage.Editor/Gateway/Commands`; host-neutral ones in `Voltage.Engine/Gateway/Commands/CoreCommands.cs`. Register one with `table.Add(name, help, (args, ctx) => …, P.Int("x", "Window pixels"), P.Str("name", required: true))`; return any serializable object, throw `GatewayException` for a user-facing error, or return a `Task<object>` when the answer depends on a later frame or event. The `P.*` helpers (`Str`, `Int`, `Float`, `Bool`, `Enum`, `List`, `Obj`, `Any`) declare the parameters that `commands` reports and the MCP schema is built from; a command without them still gets its `params:` help text parsed. Chain `.ReadOnly()`, `.Destructive()` or `.Unsafe()` to flag what the command does. Editor handlers reach the UI through `ctx.ImGui()`; adding a name that exists replaces the engine's version, which is how the editor supplies a richer `status`, `ui.info` and `batch`.

## Security

The listener binds to loopback only and requires the per-session token from `gateway.json`. Anything that can read that file can compile and run code through the editor, which is the same trust level as the user account itself.

`--gateway-safe` narrows that: commands flagged unsafe (`build.game`, `build.run`, `debug.crash`, `editor.exit`, `app.exit`, `console.exec`, `project.create`, `plugin.restore`, `effects.compile`) are refused with `'<name>' is disabled by --gateway-safe`, `screenshot` may only write inside the host's Screenshots folder, `data.create` may only write inside the project, and because synthetic input can reach any menu, the injecting commands (`input.*` other than `input.state`, `input.wait` and `input.release`, `hotkey.press`, `ui.click`, `ui.hover`) are refused as well; `ui.tree`, `ui.find` and the semantic commands remain. `status` reports `safe: true` and `commands` lists the `unsafe`, `destructive` and `readOnly` flags of every command.
