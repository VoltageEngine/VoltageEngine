description: Compile the Content folder into MonoGame .xnb files for published games, with the same loaders resolving compiled or raw assets.

# Asset Build

A published game normally ships the `Content/` folder as raw files and decodes them at load time: PNGs through `Texture2D.FromStream`, Aseprite files through the engine's own parser, audio through NVorbis and NLayer. The asset build compiles that folder with the MonoGame Content Builder (MGCB) into `.xnb` files, so a build loads pre-decoded textures and pre-flattened Aseprite frames instead. It is off by default and changes nothing in the editor, which keeps loading raw files.

## Turning it on

`Build > Asset Build` in the menu bar holds the switch and the tool:

| Item | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Compile assets on build** | Stores `AssetBuild.Enabled` in `ProjectSettings.json`. When on, every game build runs the asset build before copying content. |
| **Build assets now** | Runs the asset build alone into `<project>/bin/AssetBuild/<platform>` (the standalone tool's output, never used by a game build) and shows a report window with counts, timings and errors. The folder is emptied before every run. |
| **Clean asset build** | Deletes that output and the intermediate folder. |
| **Settings** | Platform, compression, texture options, include and exclude globs, rules, and the extension scaffold. |
| **New pipeline extension** | Opens the settings window at the scaffold section (see Extending the asset build). |
| **Show last report** | Reopens the report of the last run, including one started by a game build. |
| **Open output folder** | Opens the last output in the file browser. |

The same switch is exposed to the gateway as `assetbuild.settings` and the tool as `assetbuild.run` (`platform`, `clean`, `copyRaw`, `output` inside the project); `assetbuild.status` and `assetbuild.clean` round it out, and `build.game compileAssets=` overrides the stored setting for one build.

## Incremental builds

MGCB keeps compiled outputs under `obj/AssetBuild/<platform>/compiled/<tool-version>` and dependency records beside them in `obj/AssetBuild/<platform>/obj`. Game builds and **Build assets now** share this cache. Recreating a publish or standalone output folder only copies the current compiled assets from the cache; it does not force another compile. MGCB rebuilds changed sources, dependencies, or processor settings, and missing outputs. The first build after enabling this cache compiles everything once.

The report distinguishes newly compiled files from **up to date** files. **Clean asset build** deletes both the standalone output and the persistent cache, so the next run recompiles everything. Removed or renamed assets are excluded from the next output and index.

## What gets compiled

| Source | Compiled as | Runtime type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.png .jpg .bmp .tga` | `TextureImporter` + `TextureProcessor` | `Texture2D` | `PremultiplyAlpha` follows the setting; `ColorKeyEnabled` off; mipmaps off; `TextureFormat` from the setting (`Color` or `Compressed`). |
| `.aseprite .ase` | `AsepriteImporter` + `AsepriteProcessor` (Voltage.Pipeline) | `AsepriteFile` | Frames, layers, tags, slices and per-layer pixel data are flattened at build time, so the runtime skips cel decompression and compositing. |
| `.wav` | `WavImporter` + `SoundEffectProcessor` | `SoundEffect` | Only when `CompileAudio` is on; PCM `.xnb` files are larger than the source. |
| `.ogg .mp3` | copied raw | `SoundEffect` | Decoded at load time as today; `CompileAudio` converts them through `SoundEffectProcessor` when on. |
| `.fnt` + texture | `BitmapFontImporter` + `BitmapFontProcessor` (Voltage.Pipeline) | `BitmapFont` | Uses the engine's existing `BitmapFontReader`. |
| `.vtileset .vasset .vtimeline .vprefab .vscene .json .tmx .tsx .meta` | copied raw | as today | JSON and Tiled formats stay as files; the AOT-safe readers need no change. |
| `.fx .mgfxo` | untouched | `Effect` | Effects keep the separate `mgfxc` path from the Effects menu. |
| everything else | copied raw | | |

Files matched by an exclude glob, and files under `Content/Voltage` (engine content), are never compiled.

## How a build finds compiled assets

The asset build writes `Content/content.index` next to the compiled files: one line per compiled asset, `source path<TAB>asset name`, where the source path is the project-relative path the scene data and scripts use (`Content/Characters/Hero.aseprite`) and the asset name is the MGCB name relative to the content root, without extension (`Characters/Hero`). When two sources would share a name (`Hero.png` and `Hero.aseprite`), the later one gets its extension appended (`Characters/Hero_aseprite`).

`VoltageContentManager` reads the index once at startup when it exists. Every `Load*` method, `LoadByType<T>` behind `AssetReference`, and therefore every `SpriteRenderer`, `SpriteAnimator`, `TilemapRenderer`, audio component and legacy script call such as `Content.LoadTexture("Content/UI/Cursor.png")` or `AsepriteUtils.LoadAsepriteAnimation(entity, "Content/Characters/Hero.aseprite", "Idle")` first asks the index for a compiled name and loads the `.xnb` through the base `ContentManager` when one exists. Anything without an entry loads the raw file exactly as before, so a project can compile a subset, or nothing, and still run. The editor never has an index, so it never changes behaviour.

A compiled source is never shipped: the build output holds either the `.xnb` or the raw file, and files without a compiled counterpart are always copied. Game builds start from an empty output folder every time, and a standalone run empties `bin/AssetBuild/<platform>` first and removes any `.xnb` the current run did not produce, so renamed or deleted sources leave nothing behind.

## Extending the asset build

Rules decide what happens to an extension before the built-in table does, so a project can route its own file types through custom importers, or change how a built-in type is handled (route `.png` through another processor, or `copy` or `skip` a type). A rule has a name, extensions, an action (`compile`, `copy` or `skip`), the importer and processor class names, optional `Key=Value` processor parameters, and optionally the project-relative DLL that holds the classes; rules with no DLL use MonoGame's built-in importers. Rules live under `AssetBuild.Rules` in `ProjectSettings.json`, in the settings window, and on the gateway as `assetbuild.rules`, `assetbuild.rule.set` and `assetbuild.rule.remove`. Editor plugins register rules in code with `AssetBuildRules.Register`; a project rule for the same extension wins.

`Build > Asset Build > New pipeline extension` (or `assetbuild.scaffold name=Level extension=.lvl`) writes a working starting point:

- `Pipeline/Level/Level.csproj` with `LevelImporter`, `LevelProcessor` and `LevelWriter`, a .NET 8 class library referencing `MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline`. The game project excludes `Pipeline/**` from its own compile (new projects carry the exclusion; the scaffold adds it to older ones).
- `Scripts/Content/LevelAsset.cs` with the runtime `LevelAsset` type, its `LevelReader`, and a module initializer that registers a raw-file loader through `VoltageContentManager.RegisterLoader`, so `[AssetType(typeof(LevelAsset))] AssetReference` fields load in the editor and in raw builds too.
- The rule `Level` for `.lvl` pointing at `Pipeline/Level/bin/Release/net8.0/Level.dll`.

When a rule's DLL sits in a folder with exactly one `.csproj`, the asset build runs `dotnet build -c Release` on it whenever a source is newer than the DLL, before generating the response file. The scaffolded project references `Voltage.Pipeline` through the `VoltagePipelineDir` MSBuild property, which the editor passes on that command line, so the csproj carries no machine-specific path; building it by hand needs `-p:VoltagePipelineDir=<editor folder>/Pipeline/`. Rules are validated wherever they come from: the DLL must sit inside the project, importer and processor must be class names, parameters must be `Key=Value`, and none of them may contain `;` or line breaks; a rule that fails a check fails its files with the reason. Extension projects must stay on .NET 8, which is what `mgcb` loads. Only the runtime file compiles with the game scripts; the pipeline project is never loaded by the editor or the game.

## Tooling

The build uses the `dotnet-mgcb` tool at the same version as the engine's MonoGame package, installed into a tool manifest inside the project (`<project>/.config/dotnet-tools.json`) with `dotnet tool restore`, which the editor runs the first time and whenever the version changes. Custom importers live in `Voltage.Pipeline.dll`, which ships beside the editor and is passed to MGCB with `/reference`. The generated response file is written to `<project>/obj/AssetBuild/<platform>.rsp` and can be inspected or run by hand with `dotnet mgcb /@:<file>`; it deliberately does not use the `.mgcb` extension, which the game's own MonoGame builder task would pick up during publish.

Requirements: the .NET SDK on the path (already needed for game builds). No Visual Studio components are needed.

## Diagnostics

The report window and `assetbuild.run` list every file with its outcome: compiled, copied, skipped by a glob, or failed with MGCB's message; a file that MGCB accepted but produced no `.xnb` for is reported as failed too. `assetbuild.status` reports the tool version, whether the manifest is restored, the last output and its index size. `log.tail` carries the same lines with the `[AssetBuild]` prefix.
